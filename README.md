The overall objective from the assignment is to create a mobile and web app in order to perform a location-based quiz. This was implemented using multiple different programming languages, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL. The predominant software used to generate the applications were PhoneGap, Notepad++ and Yummy. The application was not built with the intention of commercial use, rather, it was designed to demonstrate an understanding of various programming languages and the application of the material learnt in class.


The overriding aim of the project is to generate a web and mobile application, designed to allow the user to partake in a location-based quiz. The quiz aims to provide insightful knowledge and allow the user to develop a greater understanding of both; the historical legacy encompassing UCLâ€™s past, and the modern-day architecture surrounding the UCL central campus. Therefore, the aforementioned quiz will be considered both to be within two-minute walking distance of the UCL grounds. The web application can be used by anyone of any age. The user does not need to have any prior experience in order to use the applications.
